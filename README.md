I am a physiotherapist who has discovered a new passion with programming.<br />

Backend development is what I enjoy the most. 

Now I am looking for new opportunities and challenges in the IT industry. 

I am a hardworking and highly motivated person. 

I have finished Python, FastApi, Flask and Django courses, and also a few others.

During those courses, I worked with various Python libraries and databases like Mysql or PostgresSQL. 

I am eager to apply my knowledge and expertise to real-world projects and continue learning and growing in this field.
